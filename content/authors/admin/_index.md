I am a Research Scientist at the [CSIR - Building and Road Research Institute in Kumasi, Ghana](https://www.brri.org/), with over 14 years of professional experience across civil engineering, procurement, and project management. My journey began with a High School Certificate from Lawra Senior High, followed by technical and professional degrees culminating in an MSc in Procurement Management from KNUST.

Over the years, I have held progressive roles within BRRI, from Clerk of Works to my current position, contributing to major infrastructural projects such as public health facilities, institutional buildings, and the development of cost indices.

I’m an active member of several professional bodies including GhIS, IET-G, and GIOC. I currently serve as Organizing Secretary for the Northern Sector Senior Staff Association and Chairperson of the Assets Committee for BRRI’s Commercialization Division.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about advancing sustainable engineering practices and mentoring upcoming professionals in the field.
